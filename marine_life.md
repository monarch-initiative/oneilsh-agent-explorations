Anything before the first semantic break (such as this paragraph) is not part of the document, but should be 
included in parsing so that it can be included in reconstructed output.

If a level-0 break is not explicit, then it is assumed to be present at the very start of the file with `id` defaulting
to the filename (or file path) and `level` 0.

# Marine Life
Marine life, also known as ocean life or sea life, refers to the plants, animals, and other organisms that live in the salt water of the sea or ocean. The diversity of marine life is immense, ranging from microscopic phytoplankton to the enormous blue whale.

## Fish
Fish are aquatic, gill-bearing animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates and are an incredibly diverse group, with over 33,000 described species. Fish are an essential part of marine ecosystems and play crucial roles as both predators and prey.

### Scales
Fish scales serve as protection against predators and play a role in reducing friction while swimming. The scales can vary in size, shape, and arrangement, reflecting adaptations to different environments and modes of life.

### Fins
Fins are distinctive features of fish that enable them to navigate through water. Different types of fins serve various purposes, such as balance, steering, and propulsion. The shape and size of fins are often adapted to the lifestyle and habitat of the fish.

## Marine Mammals
Marine mammals are a diverse group of mammals that are primarily ocean-dwelling or depend on the ocean for food. This group includes cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises), pinnipeds (seals, sea lions, and walruses), and sirenians (manatees and dugongs).

### Adaptations
Marine mammals have developed a range of adaptations to survive in the aquatic environment. These include streamlined bodies, insulating blubber, and specialized respiratory systems that allow for extended periods underwater.

### Conservation
The conservation of marine mammals is essential as they are integral to marine ecosystems and often serve as indicators of ocean health. Threats to marine mammals include habitat loss, pollution, and overfishing. Conservation efforts aim to protect these species and their habitats through legislation, marine protected areas, and public awareness campaigns.

## Coral Reefs
Coral reefs are diverse underwater ecosystems held together by calcium carbonate structures secreted by corals. They are home to 25% of all marine species and are sometimes referred to as the "rainforests of the sea." Coral reefs provide crucial ecosystem services, including supporting fisheries, protecting coastlines, and fostering biodiversity.

### Coral Bleaching
Coral bleaching occurs when environmental stress causes corals to expel the symbiotic algae living in their tissues, resulting in a white appearance. This condition compromises the coral's ability to obtain energy and makes them more susceptible to disease. Climate change and other human activities are significant contributors to coral bleaching events.

### Preservation
Preserving coral reefs is a priority for marine conservation due to their biodiversity and the ecosystem services they provide. Efforts to protect coral reefs include establishing marine protected areas, promoting sustainable tourism, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate climate change.
