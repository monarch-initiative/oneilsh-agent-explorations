Anything before the first semantic break (such as this paragraph) is not part of the document, but should be 
included in parsing so that it can be included in reconstructed output.

If a level-0 break is not explicit, then it is assumed to be present at the very start of the file with `id` defaulting
to the filename (or file path) and `level` 0.

# Birds
Birds are a diverse group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class Aves. They are characterized by feathers, beaks, the ability to fly, and lay hard-shelled eggs. Birds are found worldwide and range in size from the 5 cm bee hummingbird to the 2.75 m ostrich.

## Anatomy
Bird anatomy is a fascinating aspect that allows them to adapt to various environments and habits. Key features include feathers, beaks, and a lightweight skeleton, which are essential for flight in most species.

### Feathers
Feathers are unique to birds and are a defining characteristic of the class Aves. They serve multiple functions such as providing insulation, enabling flight, and aiding in camouflage and display. The coloration of feathers can be vibrant and varies widely, serving purposes like attracting mates and providing camouflage.

### Beaks
Birds' beaks are highly adapted to the type of diet they consume. For instance, finches have stout, short beaks for eating seeds, while eagles have sharp, hooked beaks for tearing meat. The beak is a vital tool for foraging, feeding, and sometimes, self-defense.

## Habitat and Distribution
Birds inhabit a variety of ecosystems, from the Arctic to the deserts. They are highly adaptable and can be found in virtually every environment on Earth. The distribution of bird species is influenced by the availability of food, water, shelter, and breeding sites.

### Migration
Many bird species undertake seasonal migrations, often covering great distances to exploit different geographic habitats. Migration is primarily triggered by the availability of food and the need for suitable breeding grounds. Birds navigate during migration using a combination of innate biological senses and environmental cues.

## Conservation
Conservation of birds is crucial as they play vital roles in ecosystems as pollinators, seed dispersers, and predators. The decline in bird populations can be indicative of broader environmental issues. Conservation efforts include habitat preservation, legal protection, and rehabilitation of endangered species.
